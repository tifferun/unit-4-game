//Below starts our JQuery. The $ symbol lets us say that we want our JavaScript to communicate with our html. It tells the computer where to put the variable 'randomNumber' on the broser in text form. It also further communicates to the computer that the location for this specific variale 'randomNumber' used at this time will be in the open span part of the text 'Number to Guess' (see span explanation above)//

With-out this the number would not show. ????? Actually I do not understand what lines 154-162 do. I even notated them out and the program still ran correctly. What is their purpose again? //
